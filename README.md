# Machine-learning_Shear-strength-of-UHPC-beams
Accurate prediction of the shear strength of the UHPC beams is essential for the design and application of UHPC structures. Ten different algorithms were used to develop ML models for shear strength prediction of the UHPC joints. This package contains the code of the model and the collected database.
